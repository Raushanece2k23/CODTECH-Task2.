OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
PROJECT:Exploratory about python programming
Objective
The program prompts the user to enter two numbers using the input() function and stores them in variables F_NUM and S_NUM respectively. The int() function is used to convert the input strings to integers.
The program then prompts the user to enter an operation among +, -, *, or / and stores it in the operation variable.
The program uses an if-elif-else statement to determine which operation to perform based on the user's input.
1. If the user enters +, the program adds F_NUM and S_NUM and prints the result.
2. If the user enters -, the program subtracts S_NUM from F_NUM and prints the result.
3. If the user enters *, the program multiplies F_NUM and S_NUM and prints the result.
4. If the user enters /, the program divides F_NUM by S_NUM and prints the result.
5. If the user enters any other operation, the program prints "invalid operation".
This code demonstrates the use of variables, user input, arithmetic operations, and conditional statements in Python to create a simple calculator program.

KEY ACTIVITIES 
The key activities used in this code are:
1. Accepting user input: The code uses the input() function to prompt the user to enter two numbers (F_NUM and S_NUM) and an operation (operation). The int() function is used to convert the input strings to integers for F_NUM and S_NUM.
2. Performing arithmetic operations: Based on the user's input for the operation, the code performs one of the following arithmetic operations:
Addition: F_NUM + S_NUM
Subtraction: F_NUM - S_NUM
Multiplication: F_NUM * S_NUM
Division: F_NUM / S_NUM
3. Conditional execution: The code uses an if-elif-else statement to determine which operation to perform based on the user's input for operation. If the user enters a valid operation (+, -, *, or /), the corresponding arithmetic operation is performed. If the user enters any other operation, the code prints "invalid operation".
4. Printing output: The code uses the print() function to display the result of the arithmetic operation or the "invalid operation" message.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
The technology used in this programming is Python, a high-level programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility.
